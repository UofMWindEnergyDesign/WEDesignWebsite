# Hey from the WE Design Team!
Welcome to our website! We are excited to share a little about us with you.

WE Design is a student-operated organization comprised of undergraduate and graduate students from mechanical, civil, electrical, computer, and biosystems engineering from the University of Manitoba. Our aim is to promote and increase the use of green energy, by providing an opportunity for our students to develop professional skills in the designing, manufacturing, and project management of our small-scale wind turbine.

After the successful completion of our second prototype, the team showcased our design at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences in Groningen, Netherlands, for the International Small Wind Turbine Contest (ISWTC) in July 2019. At the time, we were the only North American team to compete on this international stage. Our principles drive us to seek a continual improvement to our design, allowing us to hone our skills for a constantly improving team and for a better world.


#### This year, 
our team will operate both on and off campus according to UofM COVID Guidelines in the Fall/Winter terms. 
We are currently in Year 3 of our 3-Year design process and will be beginning our build cycle. This year, we continue to focus on the education of our new members to be able to build a solid knowledge base.

We will be competing in summer of 2023 International Small Wind Turbine Competition (ISWTC) with our new turbine prototype. We will be holding work sessions and tutorials on design, the use of CAD software, composite manufacturing practices, and many other areas of interest for our members!
